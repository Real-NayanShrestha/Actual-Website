<h3> The Variety </h3>
<p> We all know that when we say blue we are talking about the color but which one are we actually talking about. There is so many different variations of the same color that look so different yet are stil considered blue. You might say that other colors have different shades as well and that true. However, this problem is much more prominent with the color blue. Look at the table for some examples of colors that are considered blue.  </p>
